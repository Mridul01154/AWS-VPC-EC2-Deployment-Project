# 🌐 AWS VPC & EC2 Deployment Project

This project demonstrates how to set up a secure and public-facing web server on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** using core networking services like **VPC**, **Subnets**, **Internet Gateway**, **Security Groups**, and **EC2** instances. The configuration is fully documented and built using **Free Tier** resources.

---

## 📄 Project Overview

The project focuses on deploying a basic **Apache web server** on a Free Tier **EC2 instance**, placed inside a custom **VPC**. All networking components were built manually to simulate a real-world, secure infrastructure environment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create a **custom VPC** and **public subnet**
- Configure an **Internet Gateway** and **Route Table**
- Set up **Security Groups** with HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access
- Launch and connect to an **EC2 instance**
- Install **Apache web server**
- Access the server via browser using public IP
- Document and validate the entire setup
